# Customer Management UI – Wireframes

This project contains wireframes and UI planning for a **Customer Management module** designed for complex data entry workflows and structured business forms.

The goal of these wireframes was to define:
- Screen flow
- Form structure
- Navigation patterns
- Reusable UI components

## Overview

These wireframes were created before development to:
- Improve UI consistency

- Identify reusable components early
